* what is JVM
A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a process virtual machine that can execute Java bytecode. 
 - Each Java source file is compiled into a bytecode file, which is executed by the JVM. 
 - Java was designed to allow application programs to be built that could be run on any platform, without having to be rewritten or recompiled by the programmer for each separate platform. A Java virtual machine makes this possible, because it is aware of the specific instruction lengths and other particularities of the underlying hardware platform
 * what is the difference between a HashMap and a HashTable
  - a HashMap is not synchronized
   - a HashTable is synchronized
   This makes HashMap better for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones
   - HashTable does not allow null keys or values
   HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values

* can you override static methods
 - no - you canot override static methods because method overriding is based on dymanic binding at runtime and static mehtods are statically bound at compile time
 * what is meant by dynamic binding

  - primities are called values types
 * which out of arraylist and linkedlist are better for accessing data
* which out of arraylist and linkedlists are better for data manipulation - adding and removing elements and why
* what are the limitations fo array lists
* what are the limitations of linkedlists
* why does making something synchronized result in poor performance in searching, adding, delete and update of its elements.
* what is the difference between Exception and Error
 - Exception - indiciates conditions that an application should catch
  - Error - indicates problems that souldn't be caught
